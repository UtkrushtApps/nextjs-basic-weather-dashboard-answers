# Solution Steps

1. Set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript (e.g., `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript`).

2. Create an environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` in a `.env.local` file with your OpenWeatherMap API key for client-side fetching.

3. Create a new file `components/WeatherCard.tsx` for displaying weather data in a styled card. Define TypeScript interfaces in this component for strong typing.

4. In `pages/index.tsx`, implement a main dashboard component/page:

5.  - Add state for city input, weather result, loading, and error messages (all typed with TypeScript).

6.  - Implement a function `fetchWeather` that fetches current weather from OpenWeatherMap's API asynchronously, with error handling for not found cities and network errors.

7.  - Implement background logging: define an async `logSearchAttempt` that POSTs to `/api/log` route but does not block or show errors to the user (catch errors silently).

8.  - On form submit, validate input, trigger `logSearchAttempt` (fire-and-forget), and fetch weather data.

9.  - Render the input form, show error messages, conditionally render `WeatherCard` with fetched weather data.

10. In `pages/api/log.ts`, implement a mock Next.js API route that accepts POST requests and simulates logging (with a short async delay), then returns a simple OK JSON response. Respond with 405 for non-POST methods.

11. Style with Tailwind CSS for rapid styling or use basic CSS as needed.

12. Test the whole application: user searches for a city, gets live weather; logs happen in background; errors are shown for invalid inputs.
